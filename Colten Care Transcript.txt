Sasha. Well, um I suppose just to give you an idea of what what Salesforce and
0:08
Immersive really hope to achieve with this alongside Colton is to help you
0:11
along that longer term journey. Now, I know Will, you mentioned on the phone to
0:15
me last week that you are looking for something more long-term, obviously not
0:18
to have to rip and replace something in the short term. Uh this is really
0:22
showing you how we can help you along that long-term journey uh both with
0:26
Salesforce and Immersive. But David, I know um you're happy to drive this, so
0:31
I'll um I'll hand over to you. Sure. Thanks, Joe. So um uh like uh like
0:38
Joe said, well, we've got obly two hours keen to make the best use of um your
0:42
time. I appreciate this is the first time uh we're meeting. So um whilst
0:47
we've had a bit of a brief from Joe be really good if if you'd be kind enough
0:50
to just I guess in your own words give us a brief overview to the business. Um,
0:56
and we'll try and perhaps start with what we kind of know already and you
0:59
could perhaps embellish that and uh fill in any gaps. Um, and then it would also
1:05
be good to just get really into the meat of of the project. Um, obviously we know
1:10
that you have an existing system in IP. We know that it's been heavily
1:15
customized. we know that um it doesn't suit your your needs and that there's a
1:21
a desire really to look around for some some better technology to help the
1:25
business grow. Um we're also aware of some of your key KPIs
1:30
uh in terms of um you know inquiry management and uh you know being able to
1:36
better measure and understand um the kind of speed uh to visit and then the
1:42
speed from visit and conversion rate through to admission. But I'm sure
1:46
there'll be other business priorities and KPIs that you'll be um that will be
1:51
underpinning the rationale for the project. So if we could get get into
1:54
that that be that'd be fantastic. And then what we also thought would be
1:58
useful is um I guess to share a little bit of information about ourselves. Um
2:04
what is the role of a partner? We appreciate that this would be something
2:08
new for the business. um technology changes understand it from Joe isn't
2:12
isn't something that um you know Colton has done uh a lot of recently and
2:17
therefore um it might help for us to firstly explain what the role of a
2:22
Salesforce partner is, how we work, how we work with your teams and yourself to
2:27
make this a success and then um I guess take you through those steps of what a
2:31
good implementation looks like, what best practice looks like um and is doing
2:36
in doing so um I guess sort of bring the work that we do together to life and
2:42
then um I guess the meat of the session would just be us um really getting uh uh
2:48
into the into the scope. So as you'll see from our session today, you know,
2:53
Salesforce to your point um is the market leader. It's it's just so broad
2:58
in terms of what it can offer. Um so really what we're trying to do um to be
3:03
able to come back to you with a proposal which is tailored which is um uh cost
3:11
effective is really um distill what your key priorities are so that we can help
3:17
come back with something which is which is tailored around your your needs for
3:21
this this initial first phase. How does that sound?
3:24
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds that sounds good. So, um I'm happy to kick off with
3:29
a bit of a brief overview then. So, um we've got 21 locations, 21 care
3:36
homes. Um for us, I guess more of a unique part is everything's very close.
3:42
Everything's within 50 100 miles of each other. So, we operate just in Dorset and
3:47
Hampshire. Um, I mention that because um, one of the things we're looking to
3:54
achieve with this uh, system upgrade is better management um, of what's of
4:01
what's going on um, in the business in terms of how we deal with inquiries.
4:07
It's not looking at the necessarily improving people's um
4:14
abilities and stopping people being able to do certain actions. So, making sure
4:20
that we have a contract in place before they're admitted, that's not so much the
4:25
issue. We're we've got a very good management system in place. It's more a
4:30
system that is able to deal with those moving parts. So sorry I keep doing this
4:38
um deal with those moving parts. So it doesn't all become manual at the moment.
4:43
Everything is exceptionally manual and it is all based off of reminders that
4:47
people set themselves and their ability to remember to do something. Um so
4:55
yeah, we've got that structure in place. That means we've got a good oversight to
5:00
what's going on. It's just exceptionally admin intensive at the moment.
5:05
Um we tend to deal we've got around 1,00 residents we deal with around 30
5:12
admissions a week and equally 30 people leaving a week. Um if they leave it's if
5:19
they're on a restbite visit or if they pass away. Um a lot of business comes
5:25
through restbite to start with. Um, so we've got sort of that nurturing people
5:31
through multiple visits before they then become a permanent resident. That could
5:36
be over period of months or in some cases many years as people um come
5:44
through just because they had an injury or whatever and then over the years
5:47
obviously as they age they they'll come back. So, in terms of how we deal with
5:52
those people in the system, um looking at something that's more personalized.
6:00
Um we've got that part to it. We've got
6:06
around 2 to 3,000 people held in the system. So, I guess
6:13
Joe will know if you guys work with the care side as well. It's not a
6:18
client base or a contact base which is just ever growing because many of the
6:23
customers are elderly and pass away. So it's some sort of way of being able to
6:28
keep that data clean and up to date is important.
6:33
We're never going to have tens of thousands of inquiries. Um it's very
6:38
much down to dealing with inquiries in a personalized manner.
6:43
So another part that we're we want to be mindful of with this system is making
6:49
sure things aren't too easy and too autonomous that we lose that personal
6:54
element. So that that stays uh as a priority for
7:00
us. Um in terms of generating more uh more
7:06
inquiries, that doesn't sit as a a real goal for us with this and not in this
7:12
phase anyway. Um it's primarily down to efficiency, greater reporting and
7:18
greater insight into what's going on in in business. Um it's that that main
7:24
piece is the efficiency part. Um we're currently looking at as you know just
7:31
doing the CRM part of the system but there is discussions around dealing
7:37
with the income part as well. So, our current system, it isn't actually a
7:44
CRM. It's an income processing uh system that created a bolt on
7:51
inquiries feature, which is akin to notes on your
7:58
phone and setting reminders. Doesn't have ability to store any
8:03
documentation. So, everything as a result comes very manual.
8:07
We're going to obviously upgrade that CRM system, but potentially looking at
8:12
the income processing part as well. Um, that's something we which we may decide
8:18
on this year. That may be something that we do at a later date. But being mindful
8:22
of how Salesforce could integrate into a
8:27
new income processing system. Is there the ability to manage that income
8:34
processing as part of the project? as a whole um or do we just do it via APIs
8:39
and we just set choose a se choose a separate um income processing system. Um
8:47
that bit is just would be good to get an indication of what um what the options
8:53
are there. Um I believe that's pretty much all of it. I've got a workflow that
9:02
I can go through of what we currently do. um which I thought might be quite
9:06
helpful to give you an idea of how how we current currently operate
9:14
through that in it's quite lengthy but I can try and run through it quickly just
9:19
so you get an idea of that would be that that'd be really
9:22
helpful will so just while you're bringing that up just to recap on what
9:27
you've said obviously we as we'll come on to explain we we we do work in the
9:32
care sector we have worked in the care sector And you know we totally identify
9:36
with what you're saying um uh in the sense that well firstly the UK has a
9:42
aging demographics that there is no shortage of of people looking for the
9:46
types of care that Colton provide and um as we understand it this is less about
9:52
um uh you know trying to find uh new residents because that really isn't the
9:57
problem. It's about um improving the quality of care that you give. It's
10:02
about um making life easier for your resident managers. Uh helping them
10:07
automate what needn't be manual, reducing that workload so that to your
10:11
point they can be more efficient, they can give more personalized care to their
10:15
residents and uh uh part you know key key success driver is of course um
10:22
improving the technology that they have at their disposal. Is that is that how
10:26
you see it? Yes. Yeah. most part and then just give
10:30
it to it. The only marketing part around it is obviously we generate most of our
10:35
inquiries organically just through reputation. We don't necessarily want to
10:39
make a huge change to that side. Yeah, when we when we do get the inquiries
10:45
come through, if it isn't someone that is going to be um become admitted as a
10:50
resident within the next few weeks, they then get dealt with through
10:56
form of nurturing, form of marketing, but it's not it's not tailored enough.
11:02
So, being able to use that data you capture through their initial inquiry to
11:08
then be able to tailor that into marketing that applies to them. Um,
11:13
examples like some people may be completely bedbound and we're sending
11:17
out marketing to come to a fair like a summer fair which is just not applicable
11:23
at all and it can almost be borderline um
11:27
insensitive. Yeah. Insensitive to it. So, and then
11:31
you got the other way around and we want to make sure that I mean we're getting
11:34
the information. We're we're very good at that, but we don't necessarily use it
11:40
as effectively as we could in what uh through a marketing. So,
11:46
and of course, as we understand it, Will, of course, you are, you know,
11:50
somewhat limited by your your homes, right? So, um no doubt a key metric for
11:56
the business will be will be occupancy. Um and perhaps in the future there's
12:02
times at which you'll want to sort of um you you know dial back um uh marketing
12:08
because of course if um uh if you haven't got the space then kind of you
12:14
don't want to um you know disappoint people but equally if occupancy were to
12:18
dip then that might be an area where you might choose to consciously sort of um
12:24
amplify the the coms that's going out to to um you know the people that you have
12:29
within your database. Uh yes. Yeah. I think it would be a very
12:33
nice place to be if everything was was full. Um but I think because we're close
12:39
some homes are very close by. If some of them are running at 100% we've got that
12:44
ability to refer to our other homes and yes
12:47
pretty much always accommodate. Um so it's fairly steady in terms of
12:52
marketing. But yes, definitely around there certain points in year where you
12:56
do much heavier marketing. Um but yeah, for me it's it's making
13:00
sure it's tailored to the person. We've got that information, but we're not
13:04
using that information to Yes.
13:06
push out the the individuals on things that are unique to them. Same with the
13:10
rest bites. People visit and there's things they do and don't like
13:14
use that to market out to them. It's not necessarily for generating more
13:19
inquiries. is how we deal with what we've got.
13:22
Yes. More effectively.
13:24
And you described um is it IP your existing system? Well,
13:29
uh yeah, Cold Harbor. So, Citrix. Okay.
13:32
And uh you described that as I think a um
13:38
income processing system that had a bolt-on for CRM. When you when you
13:43
describe it as income processing, is does that handle effectively the uh you
13:49
know the the the daily charges, the overnight charges that residents are
13:53
racking up with each stay? Um and does it handle sort of invoicing and revenue
13:58
recognition? Uh does it also handle does it also handle kind of care management
14:05
as well? It doesn't manage the care management
14:08
side. That's done in a separate system. But it does manage everything to do with
14:12
the payments. Um yeah. So to your point, um one of the things
14:19
we'll need to think carefully about together is is those options, right? uh
14:24
if if to your point the first phase was just focused on CRM and uh inquiry
14:29
management and visit management and let's call it the front the the front
14:32
end of the business then uh to your point if we um if if IP is to be
14:39
retained at least in the first phase for its um income management and and
14:44
financial capabilities then there need to be presumably there needs to be an
14:48
integration between uh you know the CRM you've chosen and IP for
14:54
it would have to be it the system is so old it doesn't have the ability to have
14:59
an integration. So I would envisage when you move through that um through the
15:05
stages in the CRM and they become a resident there's an actionbased
15:09
notification which would email the team downstairs for the payroll team and then
15:15
they would manually create the record in their system. that's as advanced as we
15:20
can make it at the moment just because of the limitations of that system. Um
15:24
okay. So that's that's interesting. So um
15:29
something we could explore. So um Salesforce has a module which um without
15:34
getting too deep into this right now um has something called RPA capability
15:39
robotic program automation. So that's been specifically designed for systems
15:44
that uh uh are old and are legacy and difficult to integrate with and don't
15:49
have any APIs. Um but it might be uh an op option for us to look at um uh to
15:55
handle uh the creation of those um records in IP at the end of that process
16:00
that you were describing as an alternative to someone having to key
16:03
that in um manually. So that might be something of interest. Uh yeah, I get
16:10
that's probably one that's price dependent just because we're not dealing
16:14
with a huge volume. As I said, it's around 30 a week. So you've got really
16:19
up to that many records being created manually.
16:22
Yeah, that's just that's the quick part really
16:25
dealing with all of the invoicing and direct debits which would still happen
16:28
in the old system would remain. So I I think if we're of a much bigger scale,
16:34
there's much more value to it having four the IPs uh sorry the APIs and
16:39
having integrations but I I think in that bit at the moment
16:44
it's not where the big pain is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's solving problem that we
16:49
don't necessarily have there. Okay.
16:54
Um yeah. Did you want me to briefly run through
16:57
that would be fantastic. Yeah. Thank you.
17:20
Right. You got that?
17:26
Uh, yeah, we can see it. Yeah, if you could zoom in, that'd be fantastic.
17:30
Thank you. Okay. Um,
17:34
I'll run through it. So, basically the the squares, the blue squares, that's
17:39
just an uh that's just an item, something that happens, but there's no
17:45
ne there's no action off of it. All of the green,
17:49
no idea what the shape is. I don't know why I use them, but all of these ones
17:52
are the manual actions that are done in the
17:57
home. And then the the diamonds are sort of a decision
18:04
um either from ourselves or from from the inquirer. So I'll run through it.
18:10
Stop me if there's any bits in particular that would be
18:16
I know some things you'll have to go into a bit more depth in terms of how
18:20
you see that working in Salesforce. Um
18:25
so from the start an inquiry would arrive. That inquiry can come through
18:30
our uh walk-in mobile phone, email um or through the website.
18:39
If it comes through the website, they complete a simple web form and then we
18:45
would go and complete a inquiry form. Mhm.
18:49
No matter how the inquiry comes through initially, they all end up completing an
18:53
inquiry form. The inquiry form is completed by our customer service
18:57
advisers. We have 17 customer service advisers, basically one per home and a
19:03
couple of them work in across two locations. They deal with basically
19:08
everything um to do with the inquiries right through to right through to the
19:14
admission. So the CSA would complete that inquiry form. It's currently a
19:18
paperbased form. Um once the form is completed,
19:24
it will be uploaded to a Z drive. So as I said earlier, because the that bolt-on
19:31
system doesn't have huge capabilities, it doesn't have the ability to store
19:36
documents in it. So any documentation that we hold, we store in a separate
19:40
system um just in a a folder. Mhm.
19:44
um we will update the action of inquiry form being completed in the IP system.
19:51
So that's in our CRM. The reason for doing that is when you update it, we can
19:56
then set a reminder. So as said earlier, it's like going into notes on your phone
20:01
and saying send inquiry form done, remind me in two days to follow up. So
20:06
you'll see a lot of that throughout this process because every time a form is
20:10
completed, we have to upload it into one system and then set ourselves a reminder
20:14
in the inquiries uh system.
20:20
So inquiry form gets completed after that uploaded in relevant places and
20:25
then we'll send out a brochure. Um we'll usually send that via email provided
20:31
we've got the email address. Uh once we've done that, then log that activity
20:36
in the systems and follow up on that. We don't always do it three times, but
20:43
it it's obviously dependent on the situation. And that's another theme
20:46
throughout. This is like the the standard process,
20:50
but you may contact someone only once or you may end up doing it five or six
20:55
times. It really depends on the outcomes of conversations. So that wouldn't be a
21:00
ne like a defined workflow um to limit it, but something to consider. Um if
21:08
they're not interested, we then update their inquiry strength. So we just use a
21:13
fairly simple um metric at the moment to tag somebody um according to what we
21:19
think their likely admission dates would be. Um, so a one would be we think
21:26
they're going to be admitted into like one to two weeks. A two would be between
21:29
the next six weeks. Threes would be later and fours are sort of there's no
21:34
real date but they are someone that's inquired and we just send them blanket
21:37
marketing. That's the piece where I think we can improve upon um that
21:43
tailored marketing. Um and the CSAs in the homes that
21:47
customer service advisor they deal with that marketing um very manually at the
21:53
moment. So if we send the brocher and we have
21:57
positive engagement from that we will then move into sort of that that
22:02
workflow of that inquiry to resident side and the first part of it is booking
22:06
the show round. So we'll book that. Um calendar integrations to make sure the
22:13
relevant people at home managers and a clinical lead are available um is
22:18
important. The CSA will book the meeting and we
22:22
will do do a show around the the car space sign and the walk round. These
22:28
just demo examples of things that we would do. So there are a number of I
22:33
would call them like mini checklists and I would envisage seeing them. So when
22:37
you move them from that inquiry stage into the show round stage, it could auto
22:42
assign a checklist of things that we need to do. Um like make sure there's
22:47
tea or coffee or whatever available. Um and we would put Yeah. So we put a space
22:52
out outside. don't necessarily need
22:57
no uh need any actions off this but perhaps like reminders to the CSA to
23:02
make sure that they have done these actions before the show round happens
23:08
and again all of those are logged in the system to show that we have done the
23:12
show round. Um the other part to logging the activities is we we have I call it
23:18
very loosely a dashboard which shows the current stage of the inquiries but it
23:26
doesn't reflect exactly because it it doesn't quite align with how we we
23:31
operate. Um but at a glance I could see oh we've got
23:37
20 people in the show round stage this week. Um so that's the other reason we
23:43
log the activities. So an improved dashboard is obviously an essential part
23:47
to to this. Sorry will just a quick question where
23:51
along the the line is there any you know checks and balances for whether based on
23:56
the uh resident's preferred um admission date whether there's actually um vacancy
24:05
where in the process is that happening? a vacancy in a sense in the making sure
24:09
there's a room available in the home. Exactly.
24:12
Yeah. So after the show round when we go into this
24:16
Yes. positive like proceeding part at this
24:19
point we would start to look at the rooms. Um it's either around it sort
24:25
of the CSAs will know whether there's rooms available.
24:30
Yes. Right. Right. From the start. So
24:33
I I would like in that in the system to be able to have all of the rooms the
24:39
rates assigned to the ho uh to each room and then if someone's admitted into the
24:44
room it's then unavailable and if they're on restbite it says currently
24:48
unavailable with the available date because if they're on rest bite they
24:52
might just be doing four weeks. So, at the moment, it's just done in the homes.
24:57
They have basically a whiteboard um um and they just keep that up to date with
25:03
who's currently in the uh who's currently in each room and what's
25:08
available. That's how they use it themselves. We do have um through the
25:14
income processing system um how many rooms are available in each
25:20
home. Mh. So, we use that as like from our
25:23
point of view to manage occupancy and see where we're at on a weekly basis,
25:28
but more dynamic view of seeing exactly who's in each room and who's uh who's
25:36
leaving on what days the CSAs use that
25:40
already. Yeah. And sorry. Well, so how do you
25:44
manage the the c like the bookings there? You mentioned uh you want to make
25:49
sure that the right people are available. How is there any way to kind
25:52
of see uh you know manage the different availability and like do you store them
25:57
in the bookings in the system or is that manage elsewhere?
26:01
Uh the manager so the manager and the clinical lead and the CSAs are all in in
26:05
the home. So they're all home based. So exactly how they do it couldn't tell
26:10
you. I would be summizing they just they just communicate directly just because
26:16
they're all in the same place. So the C I know it's not smooth
26:21
because the CSA will go over to the home manager and say oh can can you do the
26:24
meeting on this day and they say no or yes and then they go back to the
26:28
candidate um that's looking the inquirer and then say can you do XY Z date and
26:34
they say yes. So there's a lot of back and forth to get dates that work. So I
26:39
would like to have some sort of calendar integration. That means the CSA can see
26:44
the availability of the relevant people, home manager, clinical lead, and see
26:50
their diary. So when they're on the phone booking in that show round, they
26:54
could say um this is the time that's available rather than having to take
27:00
dates and go back and forth. Yeah, that makes sense. basically making
27:03
sure that everyone has transparency on the calendars and
27:06
the different types of meetings that's going on with the home as well to see
27:09
that to get that front look forward looking
27:12
view. Make sense? Exactly. Yeah. One of the things we're
27:15
delivering as a capability quite often where we work ac quite a lot in the
27:19
property sector both with residential um uh developers but also office leasing
27:25
companies is also giving customers the ability to selfs serve bookings uh with
27:31
live calendar integration. Um and the reason for that is of course there's
27:36
just so much internal effort that is taken up kind of receiving emails,
27:40
offering times, waiting for the um customer to come back and choose one
27:44
that waits for them. Uh obviously dealing with the fact that in between
27:49
those emails, the situation might have changed. Um so I wonder uh it was it
27:54
made me think of something a bit bigger than just that point which is um also
27:59
the concept of the inquiry form. So does is the inquiry form does that have to
28:05
only be uh completed by an internal employee or there elements of this which
28:11
could be populated directly by you know the resident or the resident's family?
28:17
Um yeah, that that's sort of one of the things that make this
28:25
project a bit more complicated or I guess all of the care side is the
28:29
inquiry forms aren't completed necessarily by the person being admitted
28:34
into the home. Often it's the family members inquiring on behalf of. So the
28:40
inquiry form is used to gather the information that we can then
28:44
yes make a decision on is this the right
28:47
home for for that person. Um so it as I said
28:54
earlier is done on paper. It doesn't need to be done on paper.
28:58
We could have a web I would like it to be a web- based form so it's completed
29:02
in the in a system. Um the issues with uh one of the things I
29:08
looked at was having like iPads and then the homes go uh the CSAs go around and
29:12
populate the form at the time of the um the show round or when they're
29:17
populating that inquiry form. But it just becomes too impersonal. I'd prefer
29:21
to keep it in in the system with a web-based form and then they do a show
29:27
round. They mentally make the notes and then after the show around they go in
29:30
and they populate the information and then it's all stored in fields which can
29:35
be referred to and is it a document that anyone signs
29:38
or this one isn't? No, not the inquiry form
29:41
but as part of this process there are documents that that are signed. Yes.
29:46
Um, unfortunately the documents need to have wet signatures.
29:51
Yes. So, docu sign is a bit out of the window
29:57
because we need to do that man. It has to be
30:01
done as a printed form, web signature upload, but the capability to have a
30:05
space where the document can be uploaded. Yeah.
30:09
Yeah. One of the things we see um actually in
30:16
in a sort of a related sector is we you know is is in child care and sort of
30:21
nursery and um uh you know one of the things I could kind of envision here is
30:26
the concept of a sort of a private area of your website like you know kind of my
30:32
my colton or my colton care uh which could be a a place for the residents
30:38
families to um you know have a secure space to view documents to fill in forms
30:44
that need to be done. Uh you know and potentially in the future extended to
30:49
give them a bit of a window into um you know where in the process their family
30:55
members application is sitting and uh you know where you are on the uh pathway
31:01
to you know finding them a room and and giving them care. Is that is that
31:05
something that is um I'm I'm looking at the website doesn't look like it exists
31:09
today. Is that something you think would add value?
31:12
It's something to definitely consider. Yeah. Um
31:17
whether it whether it adds adds value to it. Couldn't couldn't tell you. It's not
31:22
something I've thought about in depth, but definitely something that's worth
31:26
considering. Um because I think the reason the reason I
31:30
say that is if you mentioned the different um inquiries and the way they
31:33
can come through. Obviously you mentioned telephone but you also um
31:36
mentioned um a web form and we would expect that if in the new world if
31:41
someone completes an inquiry form or sorry contact us form on your website
31:46
that would be the first step of the of the of the data capture process at which
31:50
point that would feed through into Salesforce and of course that would be
31:54
step one of of a multi-step process so that as you learn more about the um uh
32:01
you know the inquiry you can start you know If if a piece of information is
32:05
added by anyone at any stage of the process, it's just adding to the sort of
32:09
the digital single source of truth which then could be enriched by the
32:14
combination of of uh of your employees and and potentially the customer's
32:19
family member themselves. And uh uh uh I think that would be a a useful feature.
32:25
It would certainly bring transparency to the to the process and um uh it would
32:31
also mean that you're using your data efficiently at each and every stage of
32:35
the process. Yeah, I think yeah. Yeah, it was bottom
32:39
of that part is definitely so the inquiry forms
32:43
um in reality you're not going to get all the
32:47
information right away because people are hesitant there relatives.
32:51
Yes, they don't know who we are. You build
32:53
that rapport over a period of time. So we might have a very brief insight into
32:59
somebody after a couple of weeks, but two weeks down the line, we might then
33:02
be capturing all of that the detail that helps us make a decision. So yes, we
33:08
don't want an inquiry form that is you complete it, it's uploaded, it's done.
33:11
You need something that is dynamic to be able to update as we get
33:16
more information feed of more information. Yeah. Yeah.
33:19
Yeah. Um, could you just give me a quick
33:24
minute? I'm just going to pop to the bathroom. I've been sat
33:28
at all. Cheers.
33:29
No problem at all. This is really helpful, Joe. The process
33:39
map. This will be fantastically when it comes to uh
33:44
uh where we're going to go next and explain how we'll take all of the good
33:47
information that we're capturing on the call and and progressing that into um I
33:52
mean I think this is actually in some ways the the detail we thought we might
33:56
capture on in the on-site meeting whereas we're getting access to some of
34:00
that now which might mean that we can um well will mean
34:04
that we can firstly expedite things for will but also um potentially get quicker
34:09
into some kind of demo. Yeah. No, absolutely. This is really
34:12
good. Really good thing. Well, really appreciate him showing us. Um,
34:24
glad I was on mute just then because my dog went crazy at the at the postman.
34:58
Sorry, I think my Wi-Fi is acting up a little bit, but might have rejoined
35:03
quickly. Yep. No worries. Yeah, I think you're
35:06
frozen. Oh,
35:31
hey guys. No. Um, Oscar's just uh rejoining the call. His I think his
35:36
Wi-Fi knows it's Friday. Um, so he'll be he'll be rejoining us shortly.
35:41
Okay. Should we carry on or do you want Let's carry on.
35:43
Let's crack on. Yeah. Um, so
35:48
where did we get to? Um, yes. So that was the first part. So obviously the
35:51
show round's done. We've completed the inquiry form. Probably gather more
35:56
information as we've done the show round and that relationship improves. After
36:00
that there will either be not ready Um and then looking to
36:07
where we into um
36:18
we would then either move them to one of the other stages. So that inquiry string
36:22
of two, three or four, which again we'd be looking to overhaul into something a
36:27
bit more personal because they've already done a show round. We need to
36:30
then record that in the system and then we can start marketing to them from the
36:37
point of view they already know what the home's like and start inviting them to
36:41
events that they may be interested in instead of it just being a general
36:46
newsletter or whatever. And at the moment, how does your given that
36:52
uh obviously you you've spoken about a lot of um uh data is captured manually
36:58
and then there's uh uh forms being uploaded to the Z drive. You've got uh
37:04
IP being updated manually. How does the poor marketing team, you know, how is
37:09
the marketing team sort of confident of what to send out when if if there's no
37:14
integration with uh with with with um you know, the marketing systems.
37:20
Yeah. So they they would just be taking the like an export of people in the
37:25
different inquiry strengths. The marketing team actually just deal
37:30
with the inquiry strength four. So sort of the the people that are least likely
37:36
to be coming into the phone and they that's where they just send out general
37:39
marketing material. The CSAs in the phones
37:43
manually would be contacting the other people those strength twos and threes.
37:49
So we're not talking about hundreds of people at home because we've got
37:52
obviously 20 homes. So there might be anywhere from 30 to 80 people really
37:58
that would be manually nurtured and it and one of the problems is it is very
38:05
much down to the knowledge of the CSA. All of the information is available.
38:10
It's in the Z drive but the reality is they're not going to be going into that
38:14
and reading and reminding themselves, oh yes, this person really likes the
38:19
garden, so I'm going to remember to invite them to the garden event. they
38:23
just do it based off of their own knowledge.
38:26
Yes. So that's why having that information
38:29
available in fields and captured that way um
38:35
helps make sure we don't miss miss things which is carried just based off
38:40
really their own knowledge. That makes sense. And this is one of the
38:43
benefits of um you know Salesforce's native marketing functionality which
38:48
would be once the system's digitized and captured in Salesforce then um you know
38:54
we could have instead of marketing having to download uh uh you know data
39:00
dumps of people at specific stages there would be a journey a series of marketing
39:05
journeys that could be configured um and personalized to people in that
39:09
particular stage um and that could be set up more scalably and and run
39:15
automatedly. So firstly people won't forget um it doesn't rely on manual um
39:21
effort and of course to your point um we could come up with journeys that are
39:25
very personalized. So um if you know if there are sort of hot buttons as you as
39:31
you called them you know with people that like gardens that they will receive
39:34
a different message to those that are in have have other preferences and and that
39:39
preference capture a bit like the inquiry form could be something that
39:42
started early and then as we learn more about the um the the resident then uh
39:49
that will be something that can be enriched and taken into account uh in
39:52
all the downstream processes. Yes, exactly.
39:59
Okay. Um, next part to it. So, yeah, if
40:04
they're then going to be proceeding after the show round, we then go through
40:09
the sort of standard steps we would have to do. So, we would have to book a
40:16
clinical pre-mission uh assessment. So, that's just making sure that we can
40:20
actually cater for the person's needs. that would involve the clinical lead. So
40:26
again, diary access in the same way as the show round to be able to book in the
40:31
clinical lead's availability to do an assessment of the individual. That's
40:34
usually done offsite because obviously at this point they're not a resident. So
40:38
be going to perhaps the hospital or wherever the person is to um do the
40:44
assessment. Mh. that is then obed
40:49
uploaded to the system. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, if it's
40:54
positive and we can proceed, the CSA will deal with that. If it is something
41:00
we cannot assist with due to the person's needs, um the clinical lead or
41:05
the home manager would deal with that. Um those scenarios can be it's something
41:10
that as a business we can't deal with because their needs of perhaps like
41:14
one-to-one care which is not something we would do um in many cases but if they
41:20
were inquiring a residential home and perhaps needed to be in a dementia
41:24
community. That's why the clinical lead home manager is involved because they
41:28
could then refer to some of our other homes um where where it would be
41:35
where it would be a suitable inquiry to be picked up. So I guess that goes to my
41:42
thoughts in terms of how the system would be configured and I would be
41:46
looking at having locationbased access for the CSAs. Um and as um this like
41:54
let's if we've got a resident here know Joe Blogs and he's inquired at one of
41:59
our homes if we've decided he's no longer suitable for that home due to
42:04
their needs I could then add the location um Lynen House one of our homes
42:10
and then that means when the CSA logs in in the morning they can now see that
42:14
resident or sorry see that inquiry because they've been made available as a
42:18
result of the Um
42:22
so just to recap um Will so um this this um is it the GP assessment is obviously
42:28
very important that that really rules in or out whether this resident is going to
42:32
be someone who Colton can can um support and um if I'm understanding this
42:39
correctly there are obviously certain types of care that um no no Colton care
42:44
home will be able to provide you mentioned onetoone as an example um but
42:48
are we to infer that um actually different locations in different homes
42:54
there is some variability as to the type of care they can provide and therefore
42:59
um it might be that this inquiry isn't suitable for a specific home but
43:05
actually um given how close uh your homes are uh it it might be something
43:12
that another team and uh home could pick up.
43:17
Yes. Yeah. It's not black and white in the sense they can't go to this one,
43:20
they can go to this one. Um I've given an example of like a medical a very
43:27
um significant medical reason that would mean they can't go to one and can go to
43:32
another. But it could be as simple as they
43:36
use a stroller or something and they only want to be on the ground floor of
43:40
the home and just so happens the home they've inquired at has no vac available
43:45
rooms on the ground floor. So yes, we would then refer them to one of our
43:48
other homes that does have it or So do all but do all homes um support
43:53
all types of care that there's uniformity?
43:56
They're all residential and nursing, but some of our homes are dementia specific
44:01
communities. So there are four homes, I think four or five homes
44:06
that are dedicated dementia communities. So
44:11
in that sense that that first example I gave would be yes they're going to be
44:16
referred to most likely one of those four or five homes but that's why
44:21
because it isn't black and white I would have it just based on the location
44:26
location based access and that CSA would have gone seen the clinical assessment
44:31
had that discussion with the home manager the outcome is no they're not
44:34
suitable for us yes
44:36
we're close enough with the management in this business to be able to say,
44:40
"Look, I think these are probably the other two homes that they might be
44:44
suitable for. Let's give them access. They can pick it
44:47
up and then between them, they can see what's happened to date and then decide
44:52
who's going to pick it up." Yes. And when a lead comes in perhaps
44:56
through the website, you know, where there aren't that many information
44:59
points, presumably, of course, this is this is exactly what that initial call
45:05
is is uh gathering. It's those initial details that will then drive perhaps the
45:11
early indication of which home would be the best fit for the um for the
45:15
resident. And um it sounds like once that inquiry's been assigned to a
45:21
particular location, like you say, that group of uh stakeholders would only see
45:26
the inquiries that have been mapped to their location, but would be able to
45:31
refer inquiries um you know to other locations.
45:37
Yes. Yes. So that you've got the ability to remove someone from your own
45:40
visibility as well as give that person um or give another home visibility by
45:47
adding Mhm.
45:48
locations. Yeah. Um equally there's a lot of like edge cases
45:55
to it where you've got people or the the inquiries coming through. you can have
46:01
four or five inquiries
46:05
uh from the same family for the same resident but to four or five different
46:09
homes. Um at the moment that's sort of it just gets picked up. I'll put it like
46:16
that. Um, having an ability to be more aware of
46:21
that is something we're looking to improve on because
46:26
we can have multiple homes going through the same process at the same time.
46:32
It it all of them unaware that they've inquired at another home.
46:38
Can happen equally. You can have a relative inquiring and then you've got a
46:44
different relative inquiring for the same um potential resident.
46:49
Yeah. Get harder to pick up because the emails
46:53
and the names don't match. So, an ability to deal with that. I was
46:58
envisaging some form of AI agent with duplicate matching
47:04
um sort of like recommendation thing that pop up and then you can either
47:09
merge the files and keep both sets of information and then
47:15
or or you reject it because they just so happen to be very similar but are in
47:19
fact different but yes
47:20
those sort of cases. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess it's also an element
47:24
of being able to, you know, when when you identify those as well, being able
47:28
to push them from Outlook to so you have that full audit trail of the
47:30
conversations. Yes, I would expect the ability to have
47:35
both sets of information that have been gathered. It doesn't override
47:39
each set of um each inquiry because they may have inquired independently from two
47:45
place uh two locations. But when you then merge the record, I wouldn't want
47:50
the one set of data to be wiped out. It would sort of you would choose which
47:55
data set is going to be the main uh the main information and then it
48:01
would sort of just store the rest of it in an activity log of some sort.
48:05
Yeah. Um and then you can m Yeah. As you merge
48:10
it then that person becomes visible to both locations. Um, and then they decide
48:15
between the CSAs, well, who's who's going to deal with the inquiry, who's
48:19
best suited or which location's best suited for them.
48:22
And with with the CSA, so you mentioned the location specific piece. Is there
48:28
are they always dedicated to one home or is there any cross cross team?
48:33
Yes, there's 21 homes. We've got 17 CSAs, so four of them deal with two
48:38
locations each.
48:41
um they all deal with their own areas, but
48:46
if someone's on annual leave or like long-term sick or something, we might
48:53
um the
48:56
they'll then pick up another location. So, in some cases, we've got homes
49:00
literally a mile away from one another. Um if someone's an annual leave, one of
49:05
the other CSAs will pick it up. So, you'd almost be giving them like
49:08
temporary access to pick up their workload whilst they're off. At
49:14
the moment, that becomes quite difficult to do because, as I said earlier, most
49:18
of the knowledge is in the CSA's head. So, it isn't
49:23
log into the system, see where we're at, pick it up, and crack on. Um,
49:28
yeah. Context around it. That's uh missing. Yeah.
49:33
Yeah. Yeah. The context is on holiday.
49:36
Exactly. Um
49:40
so I mean we've gone quite uh deep into that bit of it but useful to just
49:46
understand the scenarios that we deal with I think.
49:50
Yeah very much. Um so after the assessment we would then
49:56
be looking to sort the admission date. Um yeah, we would then be agreeing an
50:04
admission date with that uh with the family or the resident. At that point,
50:08
we're then confirming a room rate and the next step. So with the
50:15
the way this system will work, as I said, we use the whiteboards and we've
50:20
got the rates and everything stored in another system. I would
50:26
sorry and also in the in the current system they manually type in the rate
50:32
that's being charged which just leaves too much room for
50:36
error. Yeah.
50:37
Um I would like to simplify it so every room has its own defined rate and we we
50:46
have offers which we which we send out to people. So we would
50:51
offer like a four for three offer, which is a standard thing we would do for
50:55
anybody that's new to Colton in a rest bite. So rather than having the defined
51:00
rate of let's just call it £2,000 and then because they have a four for three
51:04
offer, it's £1,500 for their first um visit. We would just have the single
51:10
rates and then we would have the percentage offerings which would then
51:15
just discount that rate. So you just have one
51:19
one um native rate and then a number of offers which just subtract from from
51:24
that. I think that's the simplest way of doing it. Um because then when you come
51:30
to annual fee increases and changes and renovations of rooms and percentage
51:34
increases of certain places, we can do that a lot quicker rather than having 15
51:40
or,00 different rates.
51:43
Yes. with then four potential
51:47
different prices within those rates depending on offers and all that kind of
51:50
stuff. So, okay,
51:52
makes sense. Yeah.
51:54
Yeah. Just quick thing on on the offer. So, is there an element of like
51:58
discounting or something like that depending on the customer and in if if
52:02
that is the case, is there anyone that needs to approve approve the like the
52:07
rates basically outside of the CSA? Yes, there's certain offers which are
52:13
just standard. Um there will always be cases where you've got
52:20
certain um certain recommendations that have
52:25
come from people within the business. So some of the more senior individuals
52:30
might have uh recommendations and then they agree a bestowed rate, let's call
52:35
it. So I would envisage the CSAs have access to our standard discount
52:43
um rates and we would define how many times they can be applied. So like the
52:48
four for three offer, you're only allowed to use that once every 12 months
52:53
per resident. So you just have a rule set up in the system that doesn't allow
52:57
you to keep assigning that. um if they were going to agree something
53:04
which was different to that, it would need to go through an approval. Yes. So,
53:08
in that instance, I would see like the CSA typing in in the same example
53:12
instead of 1,500, they put £1,200. um because that doesn't comply with one
53:19
of the other predefined um percentage discounts, it then goes to
53:26
X person to approve. Um
53:32
yeah, see it operating something like that.
53:36
Y standard. Yeah. So you got a series of um of uh core offers and then um bespoke
53:44
and anything bespoke would would likely require approval.
53:49
Yes. Yeah. As as said when we went through the start of this, there's the
53:54
ideal processes, but there's always going to be things which aren't
54:00
exactly in this ideal process. You'll have got people that skip through
54:05
certain stages. So I don't want to be um confined to we can only use these rates
54:12
because there will always be cases where things are agreed outside of that and
54:16
like that four for free offer there will be cases where they approve a second one
54:21
it perhaps they had a bad experience somewhere and now we're offering the
54:25
same thing. So a standard it works that way but you need the ability to override
54:30
it and if you override it it goes to somebody to approve it.
54:34
Yes. So when uh when someone joins they'll
54:40
either join as a restbite resident or they'll come straight in as permanent.
54:44
Um as most cases people will join as a restbite resident. Um although most of
54:49
our residents are permanent now their initial journey comes through um
54:55
multiple restbite visits. So when they come for their visit, we
55:01
have to sign they'll have to sign a terms of residence um which would be for
55:06
the duration of their stay. Usually it's 4 weeks. Um and those are created and
55:14
then they're sent out to the family usually via email. So we'd send out
55:21
invoice, terms of residence and a consent form.
55:24
Sometimes it won't be done, they won't be paid via invoice because they will
55:29
pay in the home just by a car machine. Um, other times it'll be invoiced. So
55:35
again, an awareness of it can't only be one payment method. There can be two or
55:42
three different options. Um,
55:45
those forms are uploaded to the system. Sorry.
55:48
Sorry. Well, I was just going to say, is this an example of the form that has to
55:51
be manually signed rather than e-signed? Yeah, the to yeah terms of residences.
55:56
Yeah, that that's the one form that has to be
56:00
no and so direct debit believe. Okay,
56:05
it's definitely the terms of residence might also be the direct debit um
56:09
information has to be done on done with a wet signature as
56:14
well. Um, and is that is that a Colton uh care
56:18
sort of audit process or is is that mandate coming from somewhere else just
56:23
because it's it's legal advice. Um,
56:29
fine. Yeah. Be interested to see if there's
56:32
other care people that operate in the same way, but
56:36
I believe it's because it's just more vulnerable situations. So
56:42
you've got to make sure things are done
56:46
a certain way I think with within this sector. Um but I know it's legal advice
56:52
of three sort. Um Sure. Sure. I mean look at the end of
56:55
the day I think it is uh you've answered it. It's it's quite um company uh
56:59
specific and subjective. We when we worked with K UK, they um uh they were
57:05
they were comfortable um doing everything via e signature, but um not
57:10
not not probably one to to go down that rabbit hole right now. Um my other
57:14
question was going to be um when you uh would like payment to be sort by credit
57:20
card, would you like for that to stay as it is and taken in the home or um there
57:26
is functionality that Salesforce uh Salesforce platform offers to be able to
57:31
send out payment links, secure payment links that customers from the comfort of
57:35
their own home on their phone strike link.
57:38
Exactly. Is that is that something that you uh would like to introduce to
57:43
improve the customer experience? Um it depends on the charge with it.
57:49
Usually when I've looked at things like Stripe, they've got quite a hefty
57:52
percentage that they charge. To be honest, I don't it that doesn't cause
57:57
much of an issue. These ones only apply for the restbite visits because everyone
58:02
else when they go to plan go on um direct debits. So
58:09
If it was if there wasn't a charge that we would incur for it, yes, there's no
58:13
there was no reason not to. I can't see it being something the board would agree
58:18
to lose a percentage of the income just for slightly easier payment method.
58:24
Yeah, makes sense. We'll have a look uh we'll
58:26
have a look at that for you. Right. Um,
58:33
so yeah, the usual the forms are sent out and they're uploaded to the system
58:37
after they've been signed and returned. They're then uploaded again.
58:42
And how do they get returned at the moment? Is are they do people sort of
58:45
drop them in by hand? Do they send letters?
58:49
It can be so depending on where the family is. if it's the resident doing
58:54
the potential resident doing themselves um they'll often just send them in the
58:59
post um or they'll just come into the home if they're lo they're local enough
59:04
to do that. So yeah if if we had that portal though they
59:08
could perhaps um sign them scan them and upload them uh into the as a as a way
59:16
again of giving them optionality and you know less for the teams internally.
59:22
Yeah, that would be that would definitely be possible. Yeah,
59:27
people aren't going to have like physical scanners, but if there was if
59:30
it was something where we could use like the phone scanner and send it through
59:35
that way, um that could work. It probably won't I just check with um
59:42
solicitors just in terms of the still comply with what we need
59:47
because do you have to site it yourself and yeah those kind of
59:53
things but definitely in theory make sense. Um could do that.
1:00:02
Um so yeah documents are signed and
1:00:06
completed. After that, we then deal with the admission.
1:00:10
All of that information is then moved over to the admission uh section. So, we
1:00:17
gather as they go through their journey right from the beginning. That's all
1:00:20
dealt with as an inquiry. You then convert them to an admission and then
1:00:24
all of that information is transferred over.
1:00:27
Um the payment information is added to the
1:00:32
s uh to the record. All of those documents are then
1:00:36
transferred over to the admission one. I that doesn't really seem too relevant to
1:00:40
how it would work in the new world as I would see the record remaining
1:00:44
consistent throughout that that's always um if I drag them from the inquiry stage
1:00:50
into the assessment stage into the admission stage and then into the
1:00:55
resident stage their information stays with them indefinitely. Um
1:01:00
slightly and then we just run through a couple
1:01:04
more of our sort of like internal processes. Meet and greet. Um and then
1:01:08
there are a couple of things which happen when they're in that resident
1:01:11
section. Um or sorry restbite resident section. We would do a first impression
1:01:16
survey. Um that's an opportunity. So, like we were
1:01:21
saying with that inquiry form earlier to gather a bit more information,
1:01:26
food preferences, things they do like, things they don't like, activities,
1:01:30
that information again, we we would capture, not necessarily do all that
1:01:35
much with. Um, unless it stays in the CSA's memory, but again, that's
1:01:41
something we can use to make sure that when we communicate to them in future,
1:01:46
it's very much down to it's a lot more personalized. Mhm.
1:01:51
Um during their week three or around that
1:01:55
time, um I would again it's just diorized at the moment to do this, but
1:02:01
if they're in that rest bite section, if we set a rule like a week before their
1:02:07
um before the end of their rest bite stay,
1:02:11
Mhm. there was a reminder sent out to the
1:02:14
home manager to discuss the next steps. Um in in a lot of cases people will
1:02:20
extend their stay. Um so they'll go on to another restbite for
1:02:25
weeks and then after that they'll go down that permanent route. Yeah.
1:02:28
Um or they've just come in because their family's been on holiday and
1:02:34
they wanted not to be alone. So they've just done a four week stay or two week
1:02:38
stay or whatever length and they will then leave
1:02:44
um or in some case obviously uh would pass away. So they would go through
1:02:50
a simple workflow for this. We just have a short stay survey which we would send
1:02:54
out again just an opportunity to get a bit more information. The resident
1:02:58
leaves and we would update the system with their rest bite strength. Are we
1:03:02
expecting them to come back in a few weeks time or was it just because yeah
1:03:07
like I said a family member on holiday and they've done a stay and we won't
1:03:09
hear from them again for another year and
1:03:12
then they'll contact us when they're ready. um
1:03:16
send out things with like flowers in some cases would send cards or invite
1:03:21
them to events. So this again is just an example of things that we we would do as
1:03:27
a follow-up. So depending on what stage you move them to, that would send um
1:03:32
reminder tasks to the CSA to deal with. Um
1:03:38
if someone passes away, we we deal with it in two different
1:03:44
ways. So as part of the person being admitted into the home, they would
1:03:50
either come through as local authority or privately funded. If they're local
1:03:54
authority, um the funding
1:03:58
stops the day after the person passes away. Um whereas if they're privately
1:04:03
funded, they they pay until the room's cleared out. So
1:04:09
we would need to be able to tag someone accordingly depending on whether they're
1:04:14
local authority or privately funded, not just for this reason. You'll see when we
1:04:17
go into the permanent section, there's also other bits that we deal with
1:04:22
because they wouldn't be paying privately. So there's no direct debit
1:04:26
form set up. All of that stuff's not that's ducks bypass because it comes
1:04:30
through local authority. Um and then that that's sort of the end
1:04:35
of that process. I'll move up to
1:04:39
and is this all is this all handled by the CSA as well or are there any other
1:04:43
parties involved throughout this journey? Um so for all of that inquiry
1:04:48
part that's CSA obviously the clinical the pre-mission and the admission part
1:04:54
involves the clinical leads and also the home managers. So as part of user access
1:04:59
to the system we would be looking at having three fully active users and then
1:05:04
the senior admin in the home would if existed have sort of a reduced function
1:05:13
access in the system. So you sort of got three to four people at home using it.
1:05:19
Um, yeah.
1:05:20
And then so that payment side, I would see
1:05:26
the payroll team in Colton House having
1:05:30
access to the system because when the payments come in, um,
1:05:36
they come into the payroll team here, obviously if they've not paid in the
1:05:40
home and it's done through an invoice, the payroll team then need to update the
1:05:44
CSAs that the payments's been received. So I would because there's no
1:05:49
integration capabilities I would team having access to the system to be able
1:05:54
to go in and look at Joe Blogs um account and then tick the box to say
1:06:00
payment received on 14th of November. Um and then the CSA can log in and go, "Oh
1:06:06
yeah, payment's received. We're okay for admission." Um because what we don't
1:06:11
what we don't want happening and what sometimes does happen and I'm sure will
1:06:15
continue to happen is payments aren't received and we've agreed an admission
1:06:20
date and the person's being admitted and then on that day we're like oh can you
1:06:23
make a payment and the admission should really be about making it the smoothest
1:06:28
and easiest journey possible and not sorting out payments. So
1:06:33
we try and get all of that dealt with beforehand. Um, but there will always be
1:06:38
cases where for whatever reason it can't, but that link between payroll and
1:06:45
the CSA, so the CSA could be confident of whether the payment has been received
1:06:49
or not, they can then deal with it accordingly.
1:06:52
What's the point, Will, where the resident becomes legally responsible for
1:06:58
being committed to payment? Is it the signing of the terms of reference?
1:07:02
Uh, the terms of residence it would be. Yeah, at that point. Yeah.
1:07:06
Yeah. Um, so if they go through and extends
1:07:14
their stay, we we sort of mirror the same thing as
1:07:17
if they are new. So a terms of residence is only applicable for the length of the
1:07:22
stay defined on their initial inquiry or initial visit with us. So we would have
1:07:28
to do another terms of residence if they're extending. Um,
1:07:34
so we we sort of run through that workflow again. But obviously in this
1:07:38
case, most of the time they're already in the home. So we wouldn't be emailing
1:07:42
them out. We would just be going to the room, giving them the terms of
1:07:45
residence, signing them, and uploading them to the system. Um,
1:07:51
yeah. So, and then we would update the uh
1:07:56
their new discharge date.
1:07:58
Yeah. Into the system. Um, so in the same thing like we were saying
1:08:03
earlier about having the rooms that are available, you just update it there so
1:08:06
we can see their new date they're leaving so we can have sort of an idea
1:08:12
of what's going on. Presumably you would try your best to
1:08:16
give them the same when they're already in unless they're
1:08:19
Oh yes. Yeah. Yeah. We would always be doing Yeah, we'd always be doing that.
1:08:23
And that's the other thing where it's helpful being able to see who's in what
1:08:28
room and who's leaving on what days, but we know I mean we would never be having
1:08:34
a restbite visitor in and then booking the room out from the following day
1:08:40
because there are so many cases where they
1:08:43
extend and it's not right for us to do it. So even though it's helpful seeing
1:08:48
the discharge date and someone leaving, we wouldn't be
1:08:54
fully reliant on that at all. We would always be treating it as though it's a
1:08:58
permanent Yes.
1:09:00
Yeah. Which system tells you occupancy at the
1:09:03
moment? Is it IP? Yeah, it's just Yeah, it's just exports of codes that are
1:09:10
written and then we just convert that into the homes and see what what
1:09:14
percentage um they're operating at. Yeah,
1:09:20
this is this is really helpful. Thank you so much. Uh uh when you said I've
1:09:25
got a little workflow, we weren't anticipating it to be this extensive.
1:09:29
So, this is going to be incredibly helpful for us to be able to um you
1:09:35
know, really make sure that we cover off your needs and without jumping the gun.
1:09:39
Um you know, there's a there's a big data capture part to our process. Um,
1:09:44
and you've made this a lot simpler for us. That will then make the process of
1:09:49
being able to uh, you know, bring what Salesforce could offer to life in the
1:09:54
form of a demo so much simpler because we've got a we've got something to refer
1:09:58
back to to make sure that we've covered off all bases.
1:10:02
Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, I thought but we should
1:10:06
Yeah. Would you be kind enough to because of course although we've got the
1:10:09
recording, it would be incredible if we could get an export of of this tab um so
1:10:15
that we can uh pour over it and review it.
1:10:20
Yeah, I'll try and get a copy of it um taken out and then shared with you.
1:10:25
Yeah, thanks so much.
1:10:27
Thank you. Did you want me to finish up going
1:10:31
through this after? Yeah. Should we quick because we've done we've done the
1:10:34
rest bite piece, haven't we? So now we look at how
1:10:37
and this bit to be honest quite quick because it's it's largely a mirror of
1:10:41
it. So yeah,
1:10:43
you'll either go through that rest bite and then up to the permanent stage or as
1:10:46
I said, you'll just join directly through the permanent route. Um
1:10:51
if you go into the permanent route, we deal with a financial summary. So this
1:10:56
is a bit that is unique to the permanent section. um we need to ensure they've
1:11:03
got the suitable funding to be able to afford Coloulton. Um it's not a care
1:11:09
provider for everybody. It's a luxury um luxury service. Um so as a result we
1:11:17
have to go through and make sure people can afford to be there. Um all of that
1:11:22
is dealt with by Mark so our CEO. So we would gather a financial sum or CSA
1:11:28
would deal with that financial summary. Um
1:11:33
they would have it would then be returned to the CSA from the family and
1:11:37
they would review it to make sure that everything was in there that needs to be
1:11:42
in there. Yes.
1:11:43
Um and then they'll just go back and forth until the suitable information is
1:11:46
there. Then that's sent to Mark. he will review that and decide um it's either
1:11:54
rejected and it they it's just not the right we're
1:11:59
just not the right people for them. Um in some cases we would then just advise
1:12:03
where they could go. Um and then in those cases the inquiry tends to be
1:12:09
closed because we can't cater for for everybody.
1:12:14
um if it's approved, in most cases it's approved because you the CSA gets an
1:12:20
indication right from the start as to whether they're inquiring sort of in in
1:12:26
the right place. So um at this point there aren't a huge volume that are
1:12:31
rejected. Yeah. So they all that Mark then
1:12:35
approves. It goes through the usual uploading of documentation. Um
1:12:40
the direct debit information is completed by uh given to the CSAs and
1:12:46
the CSAs post that to Colton House again because it's got to be that uh got like
1:12:52
a wet signature. We send out an interim invoice which is
1:12:58
just to cover the period of the day they are being admitted into the home until
1:13:02
our usual invoicing date. So we would just do like a twoe invoice and then on
1:13:06
the 1 of December we would send them the usual monthly invoice and just then
1:13:12
everyone's taking every payments on the same date. That's just
1:13:20
same thing. Terms of residence assigned, uploaded to the system.
1:13:25
Obviously, if it's permanent, we only have one terms of residence and that
1:13:28
stays indefinitely. Yeah.
1:13:30
Um and then go through the admission process. Um just quickly back up here.
1:13:36
If it's the local authority side, we skip through the whole financial summary
1:13:41
part because it doesn't apply. Mark still approves the local authority
1:13:47
because in some cases we you get requests from hospitals. We've had them
1:13:52
can we rent out like an entire home for whatever reason. Um that's just not
1:14:00
something we we do. So it's still dealt with on a case by case basis. Yes.
1:14:05
Um Mark goes through that same sort of thing. There's an agreement process.
1:14:09
Still have terms of residence and consent forms. there's just no direct
1:14:13
debit forms. All of those are uploaded and then we end up in the same stage
1:14:17
with the admission. Um if you're privately funded, you then
1:14:22
go down this route of the transfer. Oh, sorry. Actually, this applies to both.
1:14:29
Um, you go through the transfer of the records into the from the inquiry into
1:14:36
the permanent side, add all the funding, do that meet and greet and the
1:14:40
impression survey. Obviously, we skip that stage if they're restbite into
1:14:46
permanent because they've already done their first impressions, they've done
1:14:50
the meet and greet, they're already in the home. So
1:14:53
that's the difference between obviously the rest bite into permanent section and
1:14:58
then they just go straight through into the discharge section and they'll either
1:15:07
obviously in many cases if they're a permanent resident at this point it's
1:15:10
they'll be passing away or it's giving notice to leave.
1:15:14
Yes. Doesn't happen all that much.
1:15:17
No. they have to give 28 days notice, the
1:15:21
resident leaves and we update the system with restbite strength if applicable.
1:15:26
Um, in many of these cases, if they're leaving, it's because we can't meet
1:15:31
needs or something anymore. So, they wouldn't be they would sort of be
1:15:36
removed from the system in terms of marketing because they don't apply.
1:15:41
And if they pass away, it's that same process as we saw earlier um with
1:15:45
restbite. Um and then after that they all just
1:15:49
lead into our room redecoration process which sort of that sits separately.
1:15:54
Mhm. Um and that's it.
1:15:57
Thank you. No, that that's super super helpful. I think we've got a really good
1:16:01
flavor now for the end to end process. Obviously, it's you know there's quite a
1:16:06
lot of similarities with um you know the other care businesses that we've worked
1:16:10
with. Um, but I think a a really good understanding of where, you know,
1:16:15
because that was going to be one of our questions on today's call is you want a
1:16:18
CRM, but how far do you want that process to to run?
1:16:24
And I think that's given us a good uh flavor for for, you know, what you see
1:16:29
as the scope, which is which is really helpful and valuable.
1:16:32
Yeah, I thought that's probably the easiest way to do it because then you
1:16:35
can see what we've done. Yes,
1:16:37
quite a lot. That's not my That's not the ideal process. That's the process as
1:16:42
we do it now. The value in partnering with it is you guys have got
1:16:48
insight into things and I've got insight into what I would like to to sort of put
1:16:53
things together to refine a Yes.
1:16:56
process. Fantastic. So, well, we've been going
1:17:01
for what was that an hour? Hour and a half now, which is good. We've got half
1:17:04
an hour left. um I think uh with the best of intentions of us having our
1:17:08
agenda. We've we've sort of done a few bits earlier and and saved a few bits
1:17:12
till later. So would it would it help of us if we now um maybe just talk about
1:17:18
ourselves, our experience and also give you a flavor for how um you know a CRM
1:17:23
project would run. Yes. Yeah, that'd be that'd be great.
1:17:28
Let me just Fantastic. Maybe you'd be kind enough to
1:17:31
pull up. Yeah, Bringer, maybe we can start on slide
1:17:36
four just uh to give Will a bit of a flavor for where today sits in the
1:17:42
process. No problem at all. Let me jump on that.
1:17:45
But no, Will, thank you again for that. That was fascinating and really really
1:17:49
useful. So appreciate it. Thank you. Okay,
1:17:56
the meeting. There we go.
1:18:02
Fantastic. So, um you know, will obviously speaking with Joe and uh we
1:18:08
know that uh this is something an initiative that the business is uh you
1:18:13
know, prioritizing. So, and we know that you're obviously exploring your your
1:18:17
different options. So, we wanted to just give you uh uh an insight into how this
1:18:22
process runs and how we'll try and use your time as efficiently as possible.
1:18:27
Um, so my understanding is you've had a couple of sessions already with Joe and
1:18:31
Mary. Um, and you know, they gave us uh a much high level version of what we've
1:18:37
seen today. Um, I guess today's call is us to introduce ourselves which we'll
1:18:41
come on to do in more detail now and talk about our experience, talk a little
1:18:44
bit about how um, you know, projects run um, and what you could look forward to
1:18:50
were we to work with you. Um I think um stage three is normally a stage whereby
1:18:58
we have um uh we've gathered some high level information. Um but we need to do
1:19:05
more capture I think given just gone through and how detailed that process
1:19:10
map is. Um uh I'm not sure to what extent we'll need to do that. I think
1:19:15
that's if that's okay. That's something that um Joe Oscar and I could pause and
1:19:19
reflect on. Um, and that albeit that said it it might be helpful. I mean, I
1:19:26
guess the the question is how how much of what we've just talked about exists
1:19:30
on IP today in terms of the data side.
1:19:36
Yeah. In terms of the flow, the forms, the uh the different stages, how how
1:19:42
much of that is digitized? I know you've got Z drive. It's it's it's fragmented,
1:19:47
isn't it? across IP across the Z drive across
1:19:51
yeah are you asking from the point of view of building the system or in terms
1:19:56
of the transfer of data I'm I guess I'm asking your opinion on
1:20:01
to what extent us getting a demo of IP would be would be
1:20:07
yeah in that sense I think very uh there's no there's no real point in it I
1:20:13
could give you a 10-minute overview of it but you wouldn't be taking anything
1:20:17
from of value over what you've seen today. Um,
1:20:21
yeah. Yeah. I I wasn't sure if you meant from the data side because
1:20:24
that's a big part in terms of importing that, but I've already worked through
1:20:28
that in my own mind in terms of what what would be a realistic
1:20:34
Yeah. forward.
1:20:36
Brilliant. Well, let let's talk about that in a minute. But absolutely we um
1:20:40
would expect uh you know as part of any implementation like this that a key part
1:20:46
of the project would be what we call the data migration phase. So firstly, you
1:20:51
know, you need to be comfortable with the um solution you're picking and the
1:20:55
partner um and obviously there's a there's a build element to this project
1:21:00
where you know we as immersive the implementation partner would configure
1:21:04
Salesforce to meet the needs of of the business process that you've just uh
1:21:08
taken us through. Um but then at a certain point in time um you know you
